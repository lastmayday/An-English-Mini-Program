I'm James and welcome back to this week's English In A Minute. This week we're going to look at the differences between <bold>actually </bold>and <bold>at the moment</bold>. </paragraph><paragraph>These two phrases are often confused, so let's take a look at an example:</paragraph><paragraph><bold>At the moment, I'm making this programme, but actually, I should be in a meeting.</bold></paragraph><paragraph>So this sentence shows both phrases but they're actually quite different. Let's break it down.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>At the moment, I'm making this programme</bold>. As you can see, I'm making this programme right now, so <bold>at the moment</bold> means <bold>now</bold>, or <bold>in the present</bold>.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>But actually I should be in a meeting.</bold> Now in this part of my sentence, <bold>actually </bold>isn't talking about time at all. <bold>Actually </bold>means <bold>in fact</bold> or <bold>in reality</bold>.</paragraph><paragraph>So, if you want to talk about now, say <bold>at the moment</bold>. But if you want to say in reality say <bold>actually</bold>.</paragraph><paragraph><bold>At the moment I want to go and make a coffee, but actually I think I'll go back to my desk. </bold>Bye!</paragraph></body>"
